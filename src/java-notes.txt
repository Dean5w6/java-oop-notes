public class Vehicle {
    protected String brand = "Ford";

    public void honk() {
        System.out.println("Tuut, tuut!");
    }
}


Overriding Methods
What if a subclass wants to provide its own specific version of an inherited method? This is called method overriding.

We can also use the super keyword to call the parent's version of the method from within the child's method.

// In Car.java
public class Car extends Vehicle {
    private String modelName = "Mustang";

    public String getModelName() {
        return this.modelName;
    }

    @Override
    public void honk() {
        super.honk(); // This calls the original "Tuut, tuut!" from the Vehicle class
        System.out.println("The " + this.modelName + " goes beep beep!");
    }
}
